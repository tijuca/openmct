<h2> Server // Services // NFS exports </h2><p> Here you can edit
the NFS exports (/etc/exports) of Open MCT. </p><p>The file /etc/exports serves as
the access control list for file systems which may be exported to
NFS clients. </p> <p> The file format is similar to the SunOS 
exports file. Each line contains an export point and a whitespace-separated 
list of clients allowed to mount the file system at that point. Each 
listed client may be immediately followed by a parenthesized, 
comma-separated list of export options for  that client. No whitespace
is permitted between a client and its option list.</p> <p> For a complete
list of all options please visit <a href="http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/server.html#EXPORTS"
