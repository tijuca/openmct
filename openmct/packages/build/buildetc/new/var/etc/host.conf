# the sequence of used services
# options are 'hosts' -> use the file /etc/hosts
#             'bind'  -> use the DNS system
#             'nis'   -> use NIS
order hosts, bind

# using of 'multi-homed" hosts (on, off), that means one host can have more sperate IPs in /etc/hosts
# for example '192.168.1.10   mail.local.lan'
# and         '192.168.1.10    ftp.local.lan'
multi on

# to prevent of spoofing the resolver can make reverse lookups or not (normaly disabled)
#nospoof

# if 'nospoof' is set (on, off) the alert option will log every spoofing to syslog (normaly disabled)
#alert on

# the 'trim' option will cut the followed domain name on resolver querys 
# the trim option can be used multiple
# for example:
# trim local.lan
# trim guest.lan
# will cut of the "local.lan" from 'mail.local.lan' if the resolver should query the hostname 'mail.local.lan'
# and also "guest.lan" from 'samba.guest.lan'
#trim local.lan
